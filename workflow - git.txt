DEPLOYING TO HEROKU
    1. In package.json, under scripts, place a start property equal to the command you use to start the server, node server.js
    2. In server.js, do the following:
        a. create a constant PORT variable, equal to process.env.PORT or 3000.  3000 will be the default if there is no process.env.PORT
        b. Change all occurances of port 3000 to the PORT variable.
        c. Check if request.headers['x-forwarded-proto] is http, and if so go to the next function.
        d. If it's not http, redirect the response to "http://" + request.hostname + request.url
