THINGS TO INSTALL --save-dev
    1. css-loader
    2. style-loader
    3. jquery
    4. foundation-sites
    5. script-loader

THINGS TO MODIFY IN webpack.config
    1. Change the entry point to an array with your app.jsx, jquery/dist/jquery.min.js, and foundation-sites/dist/foundation.min.js
        a. app.jsx must go last
        b. to invoke script-loader on the min.js files, add "script!" before each one.
    2. Under entry, add externals object{}
        a. inside, put jquery: "jQuery", so you can access the jquery module by using the name "jQuery".

    3. Under externals, add a plugins array[]
        a. Inside, place new webpack.providePlugin({})
        b. Inside of this. tell webpack that $ stands for "jquery", and "jQuery" also stands for "jquery"

    4. Load in webpack utilities so you can use the $ for jquery's abbreviation
        1. use var webpack = require("webpack")

THINGS TO MODIFY IN app.js
    1. Load in the css with foundation, require("foundation-sites/dist/foundation.min.css")
    2. Add a style! and  css! tag on the front to use the special css-loader thing.
    3. Use your jquery to start foundation with $(document).foundation() method.

USING STYLE CLASSES
    1. Make sure that you use className rather than class when specifying css classes, because class is reserved in jsx.
