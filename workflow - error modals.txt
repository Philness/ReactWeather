MAKING AN ERROR MODAL


PART 1 - CREATING THE COMPONENT, START BY MAKING <ErrorModal.jsx> in components.
    A. Render function() needs a div with your stuff inside of it, and a button.
        1. The outer div must have the data-reveal attribute = "".  Also, let it have an id.
        2. The button must have the data-close attribute= "".
    B. componentDidMount function():  This is run when the component is called from the <Weather.jsx>.
        1. Create a modal = new Foundation.Reveal($(your modal ID))
        2. Run modal.open()
    C. Other stuff
        1. Make sure to require react
        2. Also, put in module exports so you can use it.
        3. Add an alias to webpack.config.js

PART 2 - SETTING THE CONDITIONS TO TRIGGER THE ERROR MESSAGE IN <Weather.jsx>
    A. in the method handleSearch(), set the state of errorMessage to undefined.
    B. If an error occurs, set the state of errorMessage to event.message
    C. Make a function in render() that displays the error modal, but only if errorMessage typeof is a 'string'.
    D. Make sure the error message gets added to the state, so it can be passed as a prop to <ErrorModal>

PART 3 - MAKING SURE THE ERROR MODAL DOESN'T BUG OUT THE VIRTUAL DOM
